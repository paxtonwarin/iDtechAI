    "So far you have been working with densely connected networks. With enough training data and enough neurons, a densely connected network could solve just about any problem. \n",

    "However, a convolutional neural network is especially effective for image classification problems. This is because convolutional networks are really good at understanding how data is connected. The structure of the network is such that it inherently learns what parts of the data matter most, and how they are connected. Additionally, for more complicated data, a convolutional network helps keep the number of neurons needed down.\n",

    "\n",
    "*  Small filters are more computationally efficient since they only examine a small portion of the image at once.\n",

    "*  Just like in real life, the filter can do a better job by focusing on a small simple problem and ignoring the distraction of the rest of the image.\n",
